'''Symmetry analysis of atoms-in-molecules results'''

def symmetry_analysis(coordinates, cell, symmetry, aim_results):
    '''Compute averages and standard deviations on AIM results of equivalent atoms

       **Arguments:**

       coordinates
            An (N, 3) array of atomic coordinates that adhere (with some minor
            deviation) to this symmetry.

       cell
            A Cell instance describing the periodic boundary conditions

       symmetry
            The symmetry descriptor that is used to find the equivalent atoms.

       aim_results
            A dictionary with AIM results. The following fields are supported
            (and the rest gets ignored): 'charges', 'populations',
            'pseudo_populations', 'cartesian_multipoles', 'radial_moments',
            'volumes', 'volume_ratios', 'c6s'. (See partitioning schemes for
            more details about these fields.)

       **Returns:** a dictionary with the above keys but where each item is an
       array with the corresponding statistical analysis. The dimension of this
       array is one higher:

       * first dimension: number if unique atoms in the primitive unit, instead
         of the number of atoms in the full molecule
       * second dimension: index can be 0 or 1. 0 refers to the mean over all
         equivalent atoms. 1 refers to the standard deviation
       * remaining dimensions are borrowed from the origin data in aim_results.
