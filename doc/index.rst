HORTON |version|
################

Motivated by our frustration with the difficulty of adding new features to
existing quantum chemistry programs, we decided to create our own *H*\ elpful
*O*\ pen-source *R*\ esearch *TO*\ ol for *N*\ -fermion systems (HORTON). The
emphasis here is on the world *helpful*. HORTON is not intended to be a
replacement for existing quantum chemistry software, but a helpful supplement to
it. Our ambition is to provide a research tool that is computationally-efficient
enough to be helpful, without compromising code-readability and
user-friendliness. Our hope is that users will find HORTON helpful for
developing and exploring new methods, for interpreting the results of electronic
structure calculations, and for interacting with other computational modeling
software. More details are provided in the :ref:`intro_horton_overview`.
