     set, the contractions are not renormalized for the sake of consistency.)
   - Fix: The numerical Poisson solver now also computes the correct asymptotics in the
     limit of small radii.
   - Fix: The two methods to project orbitals onto new basis sets (in
     ``horton/meanfield/project.py``) contained mistakes, which are now fixed.

     Stockholder scheme.

   - Improved screen output.

   - LineGrid and RectangleGrid for visualization purposes.
   - Various cleanups.


**July 22, 2013. Version 1.1.0**

**July 5, 2013. Version 1.0.2**

   - Also support dynamic linking of libint and libx.
   - Switch to libint-2.0.3-stable.
   - Various cleanups.


**July 1, 2013. Version 1.0.1**

   - Two bug fixes related to reading Gaussian formatted checkpoint files.

     1. The Gaussian 03 FCHK format contains a spelling error ('independant'
        instead of 'independent'). This is fixed in Gaussian 09. Both variants
        are now properly handled by HORTON.
     2. Post-HF density matrices are read in properly.

   - Reorganization of mean-field code. It is now located in a sub package
     ``horton.meanfield``.
   - It is now impossible to start the SCF-ODA algorithm with a density matrix
     whose occupation numbers fall out of the admissible range. This prevents
     `fake` convergence to nonphysical solutions.
   - ESP fitting for isolated systems.


**May 23, 2013. Version 1.0**

   - This release mainly focuses on real-space density partitioning
     (atoms-in-molecules) methods.
   - Other major features include: import wavefunctions from various
     file formats, basic Hartree-Fock and DFT algorithms (making user of libint
     and libxc), pruned integration grids up to Ar, checkpointing, ...
   - Experimental features: ESP fitting of charges and related algorithms,
     currently only for 3D periodic systems.
