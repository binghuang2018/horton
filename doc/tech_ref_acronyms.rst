Acronyms
########

The following acronyms are often used in the source code (and the
documentation).

These acronyms will often occur in lower case due to coding conventions.
When a class represents just one of these terms, longer names may be
used for the sake of clarity. Unit conversion constants are not abbreviated.

* AP1roG -- Antisymmetric Product of 1-reference orbital Geminal
* DM -- Density Matrix
* DFT -- Density Functional Theory
* ER -- Electron repulsion
* GDB -- Gaussian Density Basis
* GOB -- Gaussian Orbital Basis
* GPT -- Gaussian Product Theorem
* HF -- Hartree Fock
* KIN -- Kinetic Energy
* LF -- Linear Algebra Factory, i.e. class that bundles a set of related linear algebra routines.
* MP2 -- 2-nd order Moller-Plesset perturbation theory
* NA -- Nuclear Attraction
* OLP -- Overlap
* SQ (as suffix, e.g. ``dist_sq``) -- Squared
* WFN -- Wave Function
