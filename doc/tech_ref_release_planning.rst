Release planning
################

Stable API and beta code
========================

In order to ensure that users and developers spend as little time as possible
performing maintenance work unrelated to research, the developers of HORTON have
committed to providing a stable Application Programmer Interface (API). This
means that most new releases of HORTON will remain compatible with your code and
will not change the behavior of your code.

.. warning::

    *The stable API policy only applies to the part that is documented in the
    User Documentation.* All other API may be subject to changes as we make
    improvements to HORTON.

HORTON releases are given version numbers according to the `Semantic Versioning
Specification <http://semver.org/>`_, which directly relates to API stability:

- Major releases (i.e. 1.x.x -> 2.x.x) will not guarantee compatibility with past
  versions.

  * We will wait at least 12 months (typically 18-30 months) between major
    releases.
  * These releases will contain overarching restructuring of the code and
    renaming of functions and classes, including removal of deprecated code.


- Minor releases (i.e. 1.1.x -> 1.2.x) will remain compatible with past
  versions.

  * These releases will be used to introduce new features or tweaks to existing
    code.
  * New algorithms for existing features will be disabled by default in order to
    preserve old behavior.


- Bugfix releases (i.e. 1.1.1 -> 1.1.2) will not make any changes to the code
  except to fix bugs.


- Occasionally, we will release features marked as *beta* to speed up sharing
  ideas.

  * They do not adhere to this stable API policy. We reserve the right to break
    API in beta features at any time.


Unstable code in HORTON |version|
=================================

Some parts of HORTON |version| have no stable API yet because of known problems
or because the code was not fully reviewed yet.

* :py:mod:`horton.correlatedwfn`
* :py:mod:`horton.orbital_entanglement`
* :py:mod:`horton.orbital_utils`
* :py:mod:`horton.localization`

In future release, we will report in this section the API changes for the
unstable parts.


Features in development
=======================

The following features are planned or are in a certain state of development.
If you are interested in testing or contributing in any of these areas, or if
you would like to develop your own new features for HORTON, send a mail to `the
HORTON mailing list <https://groups.google.com/forum/#!forum/horton-discuss>`_.
